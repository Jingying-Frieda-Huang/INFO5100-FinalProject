# INFO5100-FinalProject - EventBook

## Introduction

The application is built to help the event management industry with the hassle of overcoming recording keeping and mainting processes involved to create and book an event. Its a multi party application with different user role based authentication and permissions. EventBook will provide the clients with a easy-to-use platform for communicating with organizers, while also reducing the manual labor load. 

### Workflow

Events are at the core of our application, linking all the entities together needed for an event to be successfull. Following are the main stakeholders of the app:
- Event Organizer
- Venue Owner
- Sponsor
- Bank Manager
- Volunteer
- Ticket Manager
- Customer

Event Organizer are the ones hosting the event, hence they will create new events to be posted on the application. Venue and sponsorship are something required for an event to happen. Thus event organizer will look for a venue where they want to host their event and according to the expense or cost, will request for a sponsorship to their event. 

Venue Owners and Sponsors will have access to the list of requests they have received from different event organizers for their respective events. They need to acknowledge those requests by accepting or denying it. In case they choose to accept a task will then be created for the bank manager to transfer funds to either sponsor to organizer or from organizer to venue owner for their respective services. 

The bank will then have access to a list of incoming fund transfer requests from different sources. Their job is to complete the fund transfer, which in turn will update the request records as well. Apart from requests, once completed a payment receipt will be generated for ticket manager to generate a ticket in case the fund transfer is for ticket booking from customer side. The debit and credit to user account balance is also refelected in positive if profit and negative if in loss.
